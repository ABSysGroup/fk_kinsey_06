Mdulo que implementa la etapa de correccin de estado y covarianza del filtro. Para ello delega en dos submdulos que se encargan de implementar cada ecuacin por separado:
state_correction corrige el estado: xPosteriori = xPriori + K * (Zk - H*xPriori)
y covariance_correction la covarianza: pPosteriori = (I - K*H) * pPriori
